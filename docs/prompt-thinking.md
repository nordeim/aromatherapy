Please take this single-page HTML template for an aromatherapy website and re-imagine it into a more gorgeous, beautiful, and appealing website with modern UI/UX aesthetics:

1. Separate it into three component files: index.html, styles.css, and main.js
2. Use Google Fonts
3. Remove any Hostinger builder code or copyrighted elements
4. Create a modern, visually stunning design

First, meticulously analyze the current template and plan how to enhance it:

## Current Template Analysis:

- It's an aromatherapy/wellness e-commerce single-page site
- Has: promo bar, header/nav, hero section, features grid, product grid, testimonial, footer
- Uses CSS custom properties (variables)
- Basic JavaScript for cart, sorting, and smooth scrolling
- Responsive design with media queries

## Areas for Enhancement:

1. Typography: Use elegant Google Fonts - perhaps Playfair Display for headings and Inter/Lato for body text to convey luxury and wellness

2. Color Palette: Keep the warm, earthy tones but refine them for a more sophisticated look

3. Visual Effects:

Add subtle animations and transitions
Parallax effects
Glassmorphism elements
Better hover states
Micro-interactions
Hero Section:

More dramatic visuals
Better hero image/illustration treatment
Animated elements
Product Cards:

Better hover effects
Quick view functionality
Image placeholders with gradients
Navigation:

Mobile hamburger menu
Scroll-based header transformation
Footer:

Better structured
More visual appeal
Additional Modern Elements:

Scroll progress indicator
Back to top button
Loading states
Better form styling
Social proof elements
I'm envisioning a luxury wellness brand aesthetic with clean, minimalist design and purposeful elements. The color palette should lean into sage greens, warm neutrals, and subtle gold accents to create that calming, sophisticated feel. Typography hierarchy needs to be elegant, animations smooth and purposeful, and everything should consider accessibility.

For the file structure, I'll create semantic HTML5 with proper meta tags and Google Fonts integration, a comprehensive CSS file using custom properties for theming and modern layout techniques, and JavaScript that handles interactive features like the mobile menu, scroll effects, and cart functionality.

The stylesheet will leverage CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts, incorporate animation keyframes for smooth transitions, and organize everything into reusable component-based classes. The JavaScript should use Intersection Observer to trigger animations as elements come into view, manage the mobile navigation, handle form submissions, and support product sorting and cart operations.
